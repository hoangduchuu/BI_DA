# Current Project State

## Project Status: Early Development Phase
The project is currently in the initial setup and planning phase. The basic project structure has been created, but most implementation work is still pending.

## What's Currently Implemented
- **Project Structure**: Basic directory layout following the planned architecture
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project requirements and architecture documentation
- **Placeholder Code**: Basic entry points for Java Spring Boot and Flutter apps
- **Serena Integration**: Project indexed and configured for AI-assisted development

## What's Missing (Next Steps)
- **Backend Implementation**: Spring Boot application with proper dependencies and configuration
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL database with Flyway migrations
- **Flutter Apps**: Complete Flutter applications with proper dependencies
- **API Contracts**: OpenAPI specification for the backend API
- **Build Configuration**: Maven (pom.xml) and Flutter (pubspec.yaml) configuration files
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose setup for local development
- **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration test setup

## Immediate Development Priorities
1. **Backend Foundation**: Set up Spring Boot with proper dependencies and configuration
2. **Database Schema**: Design and implement database schema with Flyway migrations
3. **API Design**: Create OpenAPI specification for all endpoints
4. **Flutter Setup**: Configure Flutter apps with proper dependencies and structure
5. **Development Environment**: Set up Docker Compose for local development
6. **Core Features**: Implement basic table management and booking functionality

## Development Environment
- **OS**: macOS (Darwin)
- **Shell**: zsh
- **Project Path**: /Users/huu/Documents/BI_DA
- **Serena**: Configured and ready for AI-assisted development
- **Language Support**: Python (current), Java, Dart (planned)

## Ready for Development
The project is now properly onboarded and ready for systematic development. All necessary project information has been captured in Serena memories for future reference and AI assistance.
