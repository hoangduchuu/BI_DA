# Project Language Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
The BI_DA project was incorrectly configured in Serena's project configuration as a **Python** project, which caused:
- Python cache files to be generated (`.serena/cache/python/document_symbols_cache_v23-06-25.pkl`)
- Incorrect language server initialization
- Potential analysis issues

## Root Cause
The `.serena/project.yml` file had `language: python` instead of the correct language setting for this Java Spring Boot + Flutter project.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated Project Configuration**: Changed `language: python` to `language: java` in `.serena/project.yml`
2. **Cleaned Cache**: Removed the Python cache directory to prevent confusion
3. **Added Documentation**: Added comments explaining the language configuration

## Correct Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot (language: java)
- **Frontend**: Flutter/Dart (handled as TypeScript by Serena)
- **Mixed Project**: Primary language set to Java since the backend is the core API

## Future Considerations
- Serena handles Dart/Flutter projects as TypeScript for analysis purposes
- The Java configuration is appropriate since the main business logic is in the Spring Boot backend
- Flutter apps are client applications that consume the Java backend APIs

## Cache Management
- Python cache files have been removed
- New cache will be generated based on Java analysis
- This ensures proper symbol analysis and code navigation for the Spring Boot backend

## Verification
After this change, Serena should:
- Properly analyze Java Spring Boot code
- Handle Flutter/Dart files appropriately
- Generate correct cache files for Java analysis
- Provide better code navigation and symbol discovery for the backend
